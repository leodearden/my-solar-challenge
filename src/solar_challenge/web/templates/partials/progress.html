{#
    progress.html — HTMX partial shown while the simulation is running.

    This partial can be rendered immediately by POST /simulate before long-running
    work begins, then replaced with results.html once complete.  Alternatively it
    is used as an out-of-band indicator alongside the HTMX loading state on the
    submit button.

    No template variables required.
