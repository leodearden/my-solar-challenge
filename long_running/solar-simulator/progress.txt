## Project Status
Phase: Implementation
Last Updated: 2026-01-28

## Completed Features
- SETUP-001 through SETUP-006 (all Project Setup)
- LOC-001: Location class for Bristol
- LOC-002: PVGIS TMY data retrieval
- LOC-005: Irradiance data validation
- LOC-006: Temperature data extraction
- PV-001: PV system configuration dataclass
- BAT-001: Battery configuration dataclass
- FLOW-001: Self-consumption calculation
- FLOW-002: Excess PV calculation
- FLOW-005: Demand shortfall calculation

Total: 15/62 features (24%)

## Current Focus
Implementing core simulation components

## Known Issues
(None yet)

## Notes for Next Session
- Core config classes (Location, PVConfig, BatteryConfig) complete
- Weather retrieval (LOC-002) and validation (LOC-005, LOC-006) complete
- Energy flow calculations (FLOW-001, 002, 005) complete
- Next priority: PV-002 (pvlib ModelChain) to generate power from weather
- Then: Battery state management (BAT-002 onwards)
- Then: LOC-003/004 (hourly data + caching) for historical simulations

## Feature Summary
- Total features: 62
- Categories: 11
- Priority 1: 32 features (Project Setup, Location/Weather, PV, Energy Flow, Single Home, Validation)
- Priority 2: 25 features (Battery, Load Profiles, Fleet, Output/Reporting)
- Priority 3: 5 features (Configuration/Scenarios)

## Session Log
### Session 2 - 2026-01-28 (continued)
- Reorganized files to long_running/solar-simulator/ harness structure
- Implemented SETUP-001 through SETUP-006 (project foundation)
- Implemented LOC-001: Location class with Bristol defaults
- Implemented LOC-002: PVGIS TMY data retrieval via pvlib
- Implemented LOC-005: Irradiance data validation
- Implemented LOC-006: Temperature data extraction with wind fallback
- Implemented PV-001: PVConfig dataclass with validation
- Implemented BAT-001: BatteryConfig dataclass with validation
- Implemented FLOW-001, FLOW-002, FLOW-005: Core energy flow functions
- All 54 tests passing (unit + integration)
- mypy strict mode passing

### Next Steps
- LOC-003: PVGIS hourly historical data
- LOC-004: Weather data caching
- PV-002: pvlib PVSystem setup
- BAT-002: State of charge tracking
