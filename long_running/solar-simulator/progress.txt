# Solar Challenge Energy Flow Simulator - Progress Log

## Project Status
Phase: Implementation
Last Updated: 2026-01-28

## Completed Features
- SETUP-001 through SETUP-006 (all Project Setup)
- LOC-001: Location class for Bristol
- PV-001: PV system configuration dataclass
- BAT-001: Battery configuration dataclass
- FLOW-001: Self-consumption calculation
- FLOW-002: Excess PV calculation
- FLOW-005: Demand shortfall calculation

Total: 12/62 features (19%)

## Current Focus
Implementing core simulation components

## Known Issues
(None yet)

## Notes for Next Session
- Core config classes (Location, PVConfig, BatteryConfig) complete
- Energy flow calculations (self-consumption, excess, shortfall) complete
- Next: Weather data retrieval (LOC-002, LOC-003) for PV generation
- Then: Battery state management (BAT-002 onwards)

## Feature Summary
- Total features: 62
- Categories: 11
- Priority 1: 32 features (Project Setup, Location/Weather, PV, Energy Flow, Single Home, Validation)
- Priority 2: 25 features (Battery, Load Profiles, Fleet, Output/Reporting)
- Priority 3: 5 features (Configuration/Scenarios)

## Session Log
### Session 2 - 2026-01-28 (continued)
- Reorganized files to long_running/solar-simulator/ harness structure
- Implemented SETUP-001 through SETUP-006 (project foundation)
- Implemented LOC-001: Location class with Bristol defaults
- Implemented PV-001: PVConfig dataclass with validation
- Implemented BAT-001: BatteryConfig dataclass with validation
- Implemented FLOW-001, FLOW-002, FLOW-005: Core energy flow functions
- All 41 unit tests passing
- mypy strict mode passing

### Next Steps
- LOC-002: PVGIS TMY data retrieval (requires API call)
- PV-002: pvlib PVSystem setup
- BAT-002: State of charge tracking
